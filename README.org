#+TITLE: Frowny.el

/For alphapapa, so he can insert frownies with electric-pair-mode./

This package ships `frowny-mode', which enables inserting a single "(" when
after a ":" -- meaning it'll insert :( without closing the paren.

* Installation

I use [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]], which looks like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (straight-use-package '(frowny
                          :host github
                          :repo "duckwork/frowny.el"))
#+end_src

You might need a different form.

* Use

Simple as adding it to whatever modes you don't want to always insert electric
pairs, e.g.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'erc-mode-hook #'frowny-mode)
#+end_src

* Still to do

I should probably make a =global-frowny-mode=, but I haven't yet.  It'd be super
easy though.  PRs welcome!
